LinkPred: A High Performance Library for Link Prediction in Complex Networks
This is a library for link prediction in complex networks. It contains the implementation of major topological link prediction 
algorithms, such as common neighbors, Adamic-Adard, resource allocation, Jackard index, SBM, HRG and FBM (a full list is 
available in the library documentation). The library also includes performance evaluation functionalities such as test data 
generation and performance measures.
